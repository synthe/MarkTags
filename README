This project is supposed to let users bookmark web pages and then add taxonomy
tagging to each one.  It's very much in it's infancy as I'm not that good with
ruby on rails yet.  

There are major issues I can't quite figure out yet, such as how to even 
create a form element for something that isn't in the model of a bookmark
on the bookmark edit/new page.
